# CSCE 629 Course Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to implement
Dijkstra’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm for the maximum bandwidth path problem. dditionally, we aim to analyze the performance of these algorithms and assess the impact of different data structures on their efficiency.

## Usage
This project is implemented in C++11. To execute the code, use the following command format: `./graph [vertex] [degree] true/false`. Here, **vertex** represents the number of vertices in the graph, **degree** signifies the average edge degree, and **true/false** is used to indicate whether you want to display the maximum bandwidth path or not.

For example,
```
./graph 10 3 true
```
This command generates a random graph with 10 vertices and an average edge degree of 3. It will also print the graph and maximum bandwidth paths generated by different algorithms.


```
./graph 100 3 false
```
In this case, one graph will be generated, and 5 pairs of start and target vertices will be randomly selected. Only the execution time of the algorithms will be displayed.
